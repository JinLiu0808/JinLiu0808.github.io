        <p>THE FIRST IMPRESSION<br>To be honest, that was the first time I’d been aboard. Now when I go back to three years ago that moment when I made the choice, I would like to give myself a hug and tell myself nice choice, since there were so many doubts about having this journey myself. I do not think three years of experience have a life-changing power to make me feel fresh completely as a newborn. But it does change me a lot in both good and … yes, bad ways. I went back to China for a while and after a long time of quarantine in the hotel, I had a touching reunion with my family and friends. Since sometimes I was asked to tell them the stories of living in Germany again and again when I catch up with them recently. Then I thought why not just write it down as a gift to label the closing of this stage of mine? So here we are.</p>
<p>Let me start from the first day when I arrived in Germany. It was a normal night and the day I took off from Peking International Airport. By the way, it was also the first time I visit this incredible, magnificent, world-famous airport. Then after like 22 flight hours, I saw the sunrise, sunset, and pink sky when I transferred to Istanbul. Here, I might mention the alarmingly difference between the two laps of the flight journey. The first one, most of the passengers are Chinese. But for the latter one, I was the only Asian look. From that point, I got the feeling that I was literally in a foreign area which means now I am alone. Then I was like hit by the new flash and lots of worries came to my mind. I thought about the security of the plane and doubted whether I was on the right flight. I thought what if when I land and find it is in Africa? I thought what if when I got lost in Germany and even worse lost all my money, passport, and phone… We all easily picture a horrible situation if we have no idea of what will happen next. Yeah, like throwing away from the helicopter when parachuting. The truth is the result does not always go to the unlucky side.</p>
<p>Luckily me. I landed safe and all of the horrible imagination have no clue to show up. But, except one thing. The wheels of one of my luggage were broken by the crazy plane. </p>
